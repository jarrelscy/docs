Adding to this documentation
============================

This documentation is generated using Sphinx which is a document generator 
based on python. To add to this documentation you can either edit the existing
files or make your own. Each documentation page is made using a markdown language
called reStructuredText (.rst file). These files contain links to each other within
them and provide an easy means to make web viewable content. Here is an
excellent video to show you how to do it:

To obtain the code that this documentation is based on please speak to Scott 
to get a link to the Git repository. You can then edit the files yourself
and commit your changes using Git, then the documentation can easily be 
rebuilt and the changes will be seen on the website.
